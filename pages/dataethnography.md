## Introduction and Origins of the Data    

Women’s stories suffer from what folklorist Brian Sutton-Smith calls the “triviality barrier”, especially when it comes to pregnancy birth. Emily Zarse is a fibers artist and curator, whose work centers around motherhood and pregnancy. After receiving a grant through the Bloomington Arts Commission, she began searching for authentic photographs depicting pregnancy as personal research for her next project. Her search was primarily conducted as an act of reprieve in the final semester of her Master’s program in the spring of 2024. Zarse is inspired by the familiar, but now-relic corkboard photo collages traditionally found in pediatrician and gynecologists’ offices. Carmen Winants’s installation in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) has also catalyzed an internal conversation that Emily continues to internally parse. The work, installed on two parallel walls of a hallway, is composed of over two thousand images of women in labor and childbirth. Winant sourced these photos from books, magazines, inventory of used bookstores, and garage and estate sales. At first, Zarse was moved by the piece’s ability to amplify motherhood and offer a diverse and visible depiction of pregnancy through photography. But as she sat with it longer, she began to ask, ‘Why are none of these photographs labeled? Where is the consent? Why are these physically fragile photographs depicting vulnerable subjects being installed with painter’s tape?’ Winnat’s use of painter’s tape was intentionally selected to highlight the ephemeral nature of the photos- but can’t this also send the message that these photos are not worth more expensive and professional installation methods? This multi-faceted and critical view of a niche collection of photographs is the heart of this data ethnography and will be replicated as we archive similar photographs that Zarse has now collected.    

Over the course of the spring semester, Zarse purchased photographs she found primarily on eBay, and Etsy that depict pregnancy. She remarked that finding these photographs reinforced the trivialization of the topic after realizing that she quickly exhausted search words that would successfully produce photos of her interest on these sites. “Pregnant woman” served as the most successful search term by far, followed by “pregnant” and “baby”. Emily also used the terms “belly”, “pregnant belly”, “breastfeeding”, “hospital birth”, “home birth”, “placenta”, “midwife”, and “OBGYN” in her search.  However, once Zarse found successful results from her search, she noticed many of the sellers of the photographs she has encountered used harmful tags to describe the photos, some of which include pornographic and objectifying diction. She is not sure how the sellers have obtained the photographs, some of which are now in her possession, but based on the size of the seller’s collections and the variance of the subjects depicted within, it is unlikely that the original owners and subjects are also the sellers of these photos. Over the summer, Zarse began questioning whether these photos should be preserved and archived, and if so, what the best practices would be for the preservation of this vulnerable collection. From this phenomenon, there emerges key research questions: How does one ethically archive a collection of vulnerable photographs? How do we give dignity, agency, respect, and restoration to the historically vulnerable and marginalized subjects in the archive? How can digital technologies be used to harm and heal sensitive materials?   

This data ethnography is being conducted on the photographs in this archive that Emily has stewarded for the past calendar year. The dataset I have created mimics a metadata profile for each item in the archive, which is comprised of the original envelopes Emily received in the mail from the sellers and the photographs within the envelopes that Emily purchased from the sellers. Some sellers included a printed copy of the original eBay or Etsy listings of the purchased items in their envelopes; these, too have been archived alongside any additional notes sent by the sellers. I have found interest in Zarse’s work and offered to build and analyze a dataset of these photos due to my own interest in life cycle rituals, particularly birth, alongside my interests in ethical archiving and creating static-site driven digital community archives that employ non-custodial archiving practices and minimal computing methodologies. As a graduate student finishing up my M.A. in Folklore and M.L.S., I have particularly found Donna Harroway's Cyborg Manifesto and cyborg theory as a tool to ground me in my ethnographic methods as I build relationships with individuals and record their stories. Dr. Marisa Hicks-Alcaraz and Dr. Michelle Caswell have also served as guiding beacons as I divest from custodial archiving practices and invest in community-owned archives.   

## History of the Collection  

Similarly to Winant’s collection of photographs, the materials in Zarse’s archive span several decades. Given that the sellers are in different geographic pockets of the Unites States, we assume that the photographs mimic a similar dispersion. The photographs were primarily purchased from eBay and Etsy. We suspect that most, if not all the photographs in the archive were not sold by the original owners/creators of the photographs. Some sellers listed the items as “found photos”; we suspect that the sellers have either purchased these photos through estate sales/garage sales/online/etc. or “found” by more ambiguous means. eBay and Etsy profit from the consumption and sales of the products listed on their site. Their advertisements on other web-based platforms lure potential buyers onto their site, and sellers are incentivized to sell their products quickly and at as high of a price as competitively possible before their listings are taken down from their shop page in accordance to eBay/Etsy policy. Although both sites have faced scrutiny over a range of issues, from the legality of items listed for sale to their inability to prevent fraud, they are still wildly popular leading “free market” platforms.  

## Data Structures and What Gets Counted  

Zarse, the primary collector of the photos, which are now the “data” of the dataset, would not describe herself as having a rigid protocol for collection. She searched these sites and selected the photos that were of interest to her, which were photos that depicted pregnancy (or what appears to be pregnancy) or birth. Once a photo was deemed of interest, she was able to purchase it using the grant money she was rewarded from the Bloomington Arts Commision. Over the course of her research, Zarse found that she became more partial to purchasing photographs when she saw harmful language being used in the descriptions of the photographs and as tags on the listings. As a result, the collection is comprised of many of these photographs. As an artist, Zarse is particularly interested in poses that are commonly employed by pregnant women when being photographed. There is the quintessential side profile, in which the mother is standing and accentuating the proportions of her pregnant belly by positioning herself perpendicular to the camera lens. Zarse is also curious about the placements of hands in photographs of pregnancy, which are often found on top of or below the belly.    

Apart from the physical representation of the pregnant body, Zarse’s research also intersects with race, particularly as it pertains to the maternal mortality rate among Black women and infant mortality rate of Black babies in America. A photograph is a permanently frozen moment in time, and in the case of pregnancy, the photograph captures a liminal state. The American heuristic assumes that as time separates itself from this capture, that both mom and baby emerge from a happy and healthy delivery. However, statistically this is simply not the case. A maternal death is defined by the World Health Organization as “the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes”. The CDC’s data is sourced from the National Vital Statistics System mortality file, and only features three racial categories in its description. According to Commonwealth Fund, systematic, comprehensive collection of data on maternal mortality in the U.S. began in the early 20th century in individual states, meaning that there is not a lot of accessible data about this term besides the anecdotal/ethnographic/qualitative data. This source also puts the U.S. as last amongst all industrialized countries, although the National Institute of Health's reports show that global maternal mortality has decreased since the 90s. There's many layers and perspectives to maternal death.    

Due to this lack of interest, maternal mortality and its rates in the U.S. has become an invisible grim reaper, and the larger American populace is unaware that given our GDP and influence as a world power, we have a strikingly concerning rate of deaths related to pregnancy and the birthing process. As Zarse I go through these photographs, many taken before the birthing process, our immediate heuristic assumes that the mother and child are both alive and well in the present day. However, we have no way of actually knowing this, and data would suggest that this heuristic is a bit of a ruse. Pregnancy and motherhood are further stigmatized by this assumption that the result is always positive.   

Artists Andrea Chung and D’Yuanna Allen-Robb agree that art, particularly in the form of photographs, can help shift consciousness and bring us closer to truthful narratives surrounding Black life and Black motherhood (Caruth, 2022). I am still grappling with selecting the classification systems I will employ in this project. I first plan on compiling the more "objective" data, like the date of the purchase of the photo, the object's unique identification number in the dataset, the name and location of the seller, and more.    

This process becomes tricky when one thinks of how to best describe the photographs themselves without continuing the harm already done to them. Zarse is academically interested in the intersection of race, photography, and motherhood, and the collection she has built is likewise reflective of these interests. What is the best way to represent the social construct of race in a photographic archive of strangers? How does one “objectively” describe the people in the photographs? If race is classified in a controlled vocabulary, how can this be structured so that this system does not perpetuate and reinforce power structures that run rife in human-made organizational systems- so would alphabetical order be best? Frequency of subject? Because of the phenomenological creation of this archive, this dataset is extremely unique and individualized, and bound to reflect a niche point of view. Because Zarse and I are the ones stewarding and organizing the data, our viewpoints will be directly reflected and broadcasted in its presentation, which is why it is important that each aspect of the building process is seriously considered and consulted. We will be trying our best to include the voices of respected scholars engaging in design justice, but don't want to be naive and think that the product will be a perfect result.   

## What is Missing and Forthcoming   

This photo collection has several layers that converse with topical conversations taking place in archiving, art, academia, and the American populace. These layers are hidden underneath the carelessness of their consumption and absorption into eBay and Etsy. This project will be tackling the paradox that if Zarse and I were to attempt to reunite these photos with their original owners/subjects, the only way this could be achieved is by the means of mass production, which would only further the potential harm done to these photographs by the very nature of widespread dissemination. We will be continuing the conversation of maternal mortality and its juxtaposition in an archive about birth. Additionally, the recent reversal of Roe v. Wade has been inescapable as we consider the aspects of surveillance and voyeurism that show up in this archive. These topics will be illuminated as we describe these photographs in the traditional form of a metadata profile but will then be put in direct conversation with each other as the metadata is used as the backbone for the digital archive, I will be creating using CollectionBuilder. CollectionBuilder is a metadata-driven static site template that has been created and developed by librarians. It is my hope that I move forward in this project, these conversations are embedded in the digital preservation of these photographs, all while maintaining a dedication to the dignity of the subjects within.
